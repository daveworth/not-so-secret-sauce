## Vacation Time

Vacation at Highgroove is __mandatory__. You must take time off. *How much?*
Unlimited! *How little?* Enough to keep you energized and happy!

### *How does it work?*

In order to accommodate vacations (if you don't want to be responsible for
results during that time) we require that you give us 4-6 weeks notice. Please
send vacation notices to the Office Manager AND indicate your vacation in the
company vacation calendar.

Remember, you can work from anywhere anytime you want. You don't have to take
vacation to go to the beach! You are still responsible for being an "A" player
so we know that you will use the unlimited vacation policy wisely!

While it seems like a good idea to go to the beach and get work done, working
while on vacation isn't really that awesome. It's much better to take the time
off to recharge so that you can be more awesome when you get back. The same
thing applies to conferences: don't spend conference sessions trying to get
other work done. Try and leave your laptop at home. Maybe your phone too. That
said, if you have huge swaths of 'down time' while on a trip, that can be a
pretty awesome time and place to get some work done.

If you do decide to take a 'working vacation', here are some guidelines:

* Don't think it's going to be easy, because it's not. Working on vacation will
  diminish the enjoyment of vacation until you get really comfortable with it.
* Make sure you have what you need to get work done, including any quiet/noise
  you need, food, internet, etc.
* Plan time to work and establish clear boundaries between work time and
  vacation time, and set expectations for people you are vacationing with or
  staying with. If they are trying to drag you to happy hour when you're trying
  to fix a broken test, you're not going to have a good time.
* Don't work on vacation, just take the time off.

### *What about last-minute trip opportunities?*

First and foremost, talk to your client(s). You could:

* Take a last-minute vacation and don't work at all. The client will be billed
  for a reduced strength iteration, and you will not be responsible for working
  while on your trip. This is only acceptable if your client is 100% OK with a
  reduced strength iteration! Let the office manager know that the client
  should be billed less.
* Take a last-minute vacation and work some. The client will be billed for a
  reduced strength iteration (e.g. you are "out" on W/R/F, but only take 1 day
  of vacation because you'll get done 2 days of work). This is only acceptable
  if your client is 100% OK with a reduced strength iteration! Let the office
  manager know that the client should be billed less.
* Take a working vacation and get your work done. Let the client know that your
  "hours" will be different, but that they shouldn't lower expectations. This
  sounds like a good idea but working on trips can be tough, so be sure you
  know what you're getting into. Feel free to do this whenever you like, but
  it's not recommended.

If you're on vacation for part of an iteration, you're still responsible for
results for that iteration. For example, if you're out from Monday to Friday of
a week, you still have code reviews to do for the first and section iteration
that you're missing part of. Do the first one on the previous Friday before you
leave. It'll be short, but that's OK! You could also get someone else on your
team to do your code review for you, as long as you plan ahead and it's not
last minute.

## Paid Time Off (PTO) / Sick Time

Unlimited within reason. Everyone gets sick, doesn't feel well, or can't
perform at 100%, all the time. In order to communicate with clients and adjust
expectations, please notify Client(s) and the Office Manager as soon as
possible so we can alter the results (both billing and expected output).

PTO is not tracked according to our ROWE policy. We expect you to manage your
time off accordingly and as a guide, most companies our size provide up to 15
days PTO.

### General PTO Rules/Guidelines:

* If visibly sick or contagious, do not come into the office (or go to co-work
  space, coffee shops, or anywhere) to spread germs.
* Let your client(s) know you're sick, out, and unavailable to work.  You can
  use the term PTO (Paid Time Off) because that is what they understand.
* Get better, get rested, or schedule doctor or clinic visit so you can come
  back and kick ass.

## Holidays

Holidays look suspiciously similar to vacations. These are on the calendar, and
it's assumed that most people will take most of these days off, but it's also
completely ok to work on them instead. The office will be 'closed', but the
only thing this really matters for is billing/invoicing (e.g. we don't expect
clients to mail us checks on Memorial Day).

As far as you are concerned, all the same rules apply, let your Client(s) and
Office Manager know, and be reasonable! If you'd like to take a holiday for Kal
Rekk or any other personal/religious/cultural/etc holiday, it's just like a
vacation day and we'll see you when you get back.

The office will be 'closed' each year for: Memorial Day, Independence Day,
Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and the following day, Christmas Day, New Years Day,
and 3 'floating' holidays that typically are used to make a long break for
Christmas/New Years.

In 2012 this is:

* Monday, January 2 New Year's Day
* Monday, May 28 Memorial Day
* Wednesday, July 4 Independence Day
* Monday, September 3 Labor Day
* Thursday, November 22 Thanksgiving Day and Friday, November 23
* Tuesday, December 25 Christmas Day
