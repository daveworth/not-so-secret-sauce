# Intention

* A fun presentation on any topic under the sun that is some combination of new,
  relevant, interesting, or obscure.
* Presented by someone that is a subject matter expert, or that has prepared
  themselves enough to present and answer in-depth questions.
* Only as long as needed. Most things can be done in 15 minutes, and it's rare
  that a whole hour will be needed.

# Attending

* Totally optional.
* Broadcast live via GoToMeeting and recorded for watching later on Vimeo.
* Anyone is welcome to attend as long as they commit to presenting a topic at
  some point in the future.
* Topics and talk durations should be listed so you know what to expect before
  you show up.

# Presenting

* Your topic and estimated talk duration needs to be posted with the meeting
  invite earlier in the week so that people can decide if they want to attend.
* Presentations should not include Company Confidential Information. This
  includes mentions of client names and confidential aspects of those projects.
  Company Confidential Information related questions should be held to the end
  once recording has stopped.
* Turn off your email, turn off your timer, turn off your growl notifications,
  and don't mention any of our clients unless you have asked permission to do
  so!
* Repeat questions from the audience so that they can be heard in the recording.
* Make sure someone is recording the talk.
